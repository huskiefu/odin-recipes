    <h4>'Gu Lao Rou' or Sweet And Sour Pork is a dish originating from the Jiangsu Province of China. As the dish was spread throughout China and then around the world, every country has put its own ethnic twist on it. The sweet and sour pork we will be going through today is the traditional kind, which can still be found in almost every traditional chinese restaurant today, so popular that it has become a part of cuisine in areas like Singapore today. For those who cannot consume pork, we suggest substituting the protein with fish instead.</h4>

    <p>The recipe below comprises of two parts, the crispy fried pork and the sumptious sweet and sour sauce. Do feel free to taste and adjust the various quantities of ingredients to suit your own preferences. Sweet and sour may be something new to the western palette so we do suggest you brace yourself for the burst of umami you are about to experience.</p>
